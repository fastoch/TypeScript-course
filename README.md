# Intro

This course gives you an understanding of the fundamentals of TS and why it's so useful.

## Reasons to use TS

- app-crashing runtime errors are dramatically reduced by TS, which checks the code at compile time before it ever gets deployed
- using TS "turns on" a number of neat features that make your dev life a lot easier:
  - autocompletion
  - refactoring capabilities
  - immediate error checking
  - and more
- TS is now considered a critical skill by most companies, knowing a little TS can set you apart from other junior dev candidates

## Overview

- Basic, literal, and custom types
- optional properties
- union types
- type narrowing
- built-in utility types
- generics: allow you to create your own utility types, or to make your functions and other types more flexible
