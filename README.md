# Intro

## Reasons to use TS

- app-crashing runtime errors are dramatically reduced by TS, which checks the code at compile time before it ever gets deployed
- using TS "turns on" a number of neat features that make your dev life a lot easier:
  - autocompletion
  - refactoring capabilities
  - immediate error checking
  - and more
- TS is now considered as a critical skill by most companies, knowing a little TS can set you apart from other candidates
